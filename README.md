## Azure Chat service For Health Diagnostics

## Overview

## Problem Statement
Increased demand for health care has produce overhead for healthcare professionals. Website for health service could include health bots which would reduce this overhead. Medical bots would help reducing hospital visits, unnecessary treatments and procedures, and decreasing hospital admissions as knowledge about their symptoms improve. For patients, this comes with a lot of benefits: less time spent commuting to the doctorâ€™s office, less money spent on unnecessary treatments.
People can now easily provide their symptoms and get a rough diagnosis of their disease, just by chatting with the bot.
